  # We use setuptools with the --single-version-externally-managed flag,
  # which is what e.g. Linux distros do to avoid egg-subdirectories. This
  # particular code is lifted from pip to be compatible with both setuptools
  # packages and distutils packages, so that the packages doesn't need to
  # care about distutils vs. setuptools. The distutils.yaml file is then
  # primarily useful to install 'distribute'.
